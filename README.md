> **Good news: [s2arm.com](https://s2arm.com) is now the official S2Arm website.** S2Arm is free and open source and never accepts donations; get S2Arm only from [s2arm.com](https://s2arm.com) or this GitHub repository.

**Your own Switch games, running natively on iPhone, iPad and Mac.** Game code is rewritten to native ARM64 and runs directly on the device's processor, with graphics going straight to Metal. Your whole library lives in one app, and a few clicks in the Mac or Windows launcher take a game from import to play.

Platforms: iPhone / iPad (iOS / iPadOS 18 and later) · Mac (Apple silicon, macOS 15 and later) · Build on Mac or Windows · Android / HarmonyOS coming soon · License: Apache-2.0 · **Bring your own games**

## A native port, not an emulator

The game's own ARM64 code is rewritten at build time and then runs directly on the processor in your iPhone, iPad or Mac. There is no CPU emulator in between. Graphics calls are translated straight to Metal, and system services come from a native host. That is where the speed, the low heat and the battery life come from. [Evidence](docs/validation/EVIDENCE.md#native-port)

## One app, your whole library

Every game you import goes into the same S2Arm app; open it and pick what to play. The whole library takes a single App slot on your developer account, so adding a game never means installing another app or spending another signing slot. [Evidence](docs/validation/EVIDENCE.md#one-app-whole-library)

## Graphical launchers, next to zero setup

There is a graphical launcher for Mac and one for Windows. On first launch the welcome page boils everything down to three steps: get this computer ready, add your keys, add your games, with a single primary button at any moment. Everything else is either bundled or fetched in one click, and you never touch a command line.

After you click Build, every stage shows its progress, elapsed and remaining time, and disk use. Several games can queue up and build one after another. [Evidence](docs/validation/EVIDENCE.md#graphical-launchers)

## Let an AI drive

Both the Mac and Windows launchers expose a control interface, `s2armctl`. An AI assistant can import games, build, install, follow progress and read errors, and every step shows up in the launcher window. A companion self-check, self-fix and feedback toolkit lets the AI find a problem, apply the documented fix, and, when it cannot, package a diagnostic bundle for you to file. Watch an AI diagnose and fix a real problem end to end: [Evidence](docs/validation/EVIDENCE.md#ai-at-the-wheel)

### Have an AI do it for you

Send this to your AI assistant (it needs to be able to run commands on your computer):

> Please read https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/S2Arm/blob/main/launchers/macos/skill/s2arm-operator/SKILL.md and then help me install my Switch game on my iPhone.

It moves forward with a few commands, and you can watch every step in the launcher window:

```bash
/Applications/S2Arm.app/Contents/Resources/s2armctl start        # open and connect to the launcher
/Applications/S2Arm.app/Contents/Resources/s2armctl next         # what to do now, who does it, and why
/Applications/S2Arm.app/Contents/Resources/s2armctl diag export ~/Desktop/S2Arm-diagnostics.zip   # export a diagnostic bundle if it cannot fix a problem
```

Anything only you can do (system permission prompts, signing in with your Apple ID, tapping Trust on your phone), the AI stops and asks you to do. On Windows, use `s2armctl.cmd` in the launcher folder with the same commands. Windows builds iPhone / iPad packages only, so for problems inside a game export the diagnostic bundle on the phone: long-press the game screen with four fingers for 1.5 seconds and choose Export diagnostics.

**Something wrong inside a game** (graphics, frame rate, stutter, crashes)? Send your AI:

> Please read https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/S2Arm/blob/main/skills/player-game-triage/SKILL.md . My S2Arm game has this problem: <describe it>. Check the settings first, then collect diagnostics; if you can change code, fix it at the root and open a PR, otherwise help me file an issue.

## Tested at scale

**211** games surveyed with a **95%** first-try build success rate. **4,700+** test runs on real iOS devices and **1,000+** on macOS. [Evidence](docs/validation/EVIDENCE.md#tested-at-scale)

## Fast, smooth, and easy on the battery

On a 16 GB MacBook Air (M3), from importing a game to a finished iPhone build, completely cold:

| Game | Game files | Shaders | Build time |
|---|---|---|---|
| A 23.5 GB action RPG | 23.5 GB | 1,222 | **6.4 min** |
| A 12.0 GB life-sim game | 12.0 GB | 9,315 | **8.6 min** |
| A 17.5 GB open-world game | 17.5 GB | 26,999 | **34 min** |

A Switch 2 game, measured on an iPhone 17 Pro Max: a **full 60 fps** while the phone is cool, **37–43 fps** once sustained load has heated it up, at about **0.15 J per frame**. [Evidence](docs/validation/EVIDENCE.md#speed-and-efficiency)

## Platforms

| Platform | Support |
|---|---|
| iPhone / iPad | iOS / iPadOS 18 and later; every game is chosen inside one app |
| Mac | Apple silicon, macOS 15 and later; builds locally and plays games right on the Mac |
| Windows | Graphical launcher that builds and installs games for iPhone / iPad |
| Android / HarmonyOS | Coming soon |

[Evidence](docs/validation/EVIDENCE.md#platforms)

## Downstream deep ports

Some games have a deep port made specially by the community. S2Arm recognizes these games: on export it shows a page explaining the option, and you can switch to the downstream project's route (importing, packing and installing are still buttons in S2Arm, with the downstream project's implementation underneath) or keep the standard route. The registry is [`pack/downstream/schemes.json`](pack/downstream/schemes.json); the contract between the two is the downstream project's document.

| Route | Project | Devices | Contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| D2R-Mobile | [jhaizhou-ops/d2r-mobile](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/d2r-mobile) | iPhone / iPad (iOS 26 and later; Android and HarmonyOS in progress) | [docs/S2ARM.md](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/d2r-mobile/blob/main/docs/S2ARM.md) |

## Getting started

1. Download the Mac or Windows launcher from the [download page](https://jhaizhou-ops.github.io/S2Arm/) and open it. Building for iPhone on a Mac needs the free Xcode from the App Store, signed in with your Apple ID; the launcher walks you through it.
2. Import your own keys and games. Put the base game, updates and DLC in one folder and import them together.
3. Choose iPhone / iPad or this Mac, then click Build.
4. Follow the launcher to sign and install with your own Apple ID (the Windows launcher ships with the Impactor signing tool), open S2Arm, and pick a game from the library.

Back up your saves before updating the app. The release uses the new app identifier `io.s2arm.*`, which the system treats as a new app: saves from the beta builds do not carry over automatically.

## Honest boundaries

S2Arm runs 64-bit (AArch64) games. Apple silicon cannot execute 32-bit ARM code, so 32-bit games are outside what S2Arm supports, as are games that need a 36-bit address space.

- **Virtual gamepad and gear menu**: the in-game gear menu and in-place gamepad editing on iOS follow the MeloNX-style design that [@neexuan](https://github.com/neexuan) brought in [#134](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/S2Arm/pull/134); S2Arm reimplemented it from scratch. Thanks to MeloNX for exploring this interaction on iOS.
