#   · BNSH ('BNSH\0\0\0\0', carried by bfsha / particle effect esetb / UI layout blarc / embedded in main):
#       +0x60 grsc block; +0x7c variation count u32; +0x80 variation table pointer (pointers are relative to the BNSH start). A variation is 0x40 bytes; the binary program is at +0x10;
#       the binary program has 6 stage pointers from +0x08: vertex, hull, domain, geometry, pixel, compute; the stage code descriptor has +0x08 control pointer, +0x10 code area pointer, +0x18 code area length, +0x1c control length.
#   · BAHS (agl's sharcb: the agl / gsys resource packs, GameAglShader in the Secred pack): file header +0x1c code region start, +0x18 code region length;
#       each binary entry in the table area is 16 bytes {code offset (relative to the code region, 0x100-aligned), 0, control length 0x880 / 0x88c (3D World 0x848), signed offset of the control relative to this entry's address}.
#       Control sections are shared between programs, so pairing goes by entry, never by finding code from a control; entries are recognized by a triple check of "control magic + code magic + consistent lengths".
#       NVN2 (Switch 2) BAHS entries hold 0xd8-byte NVN2 control sections (see bahs_shaders); agl's NDSR pack (agl_ndsr.pck) and sead's NVN2 primitive drawer have layouts of their own (ndsr_shaders, sead_prim_shaders)
#   · Unity (UnityFS bundles and the serialized files under Data, read by unityfs.py): the Switch subprograms of each Shader object; the program code = a 0x60 header + one block per stage.
#       The header is 4 i32 ×6 arrays indexed by NVN stage (0 vertex 1 pixel 2 geometry 3 hull 4 domain 5 compute): [0] unused (0 or a scratch size), [1] block offset (from +0x60, -1 = no such stage), [2] control length, [3] code length;
#       block = control section + code area. A program's vertex / pixel stages form a pair. The game's own serialized files (data.unity3d, unity default resources) carry no type trees and borrow the bundles' Shader type tree of the same hash (second pass),
#       or take the layout unityfs.py has for that hash (KNOWN_TREES), or else the one generated from the Unity version the file records (unityfs.shader_layout), when no bundle has one
#       (Brain Memory Training Academy, Unity 2022.3: no bundles at all; Lost Castle / Romancing SaGa 3, 2017.4; ShakesOnAPlane, 2019.2; Terraria, 2019.4). Compute shaders without a tree have their
#       kernels' code found in the object bytes (unity_scan_kernels). An empty or inconsistent program block is left out, reported and counted (unity_program), not the end of the extraction
#       Before 2019.3 (Cuphead, Unity 2017.4; found by armyja, GitHub pull request #2) a subprogram holds one stage: program code = a 0x10 header {?, ?, control length, code length} + control section
#       + code area, and the stage is not in the code but in the Shader's m_ParsedForm (unity_stages)
#       Unity 2022 (Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, 2022.3) keeps the 0x60 header in the program code, but the blob also holds parameter entries, which unity_code_blobs leaves out
#   · MSHD (MercurySteam, Metroid Dread system/shd/*.bshdat): each stage = a control section (+0x20 = control length; sometimes a small compiler option table follows) + the code area starting at the next code header;
#       NV assembly text follows the first 0x880 bytes of the control section, and SASS disassembly text follows the code area. All 478 files hold "vertex, pixel" in pairs (1, 2 or 4 pairs), paired two by two in order
#   · G2S (Koei Tecmo's KTGL, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity): GLSLC compiler outputs inside the IDRK entries of the RDB data files (zlib in chunks), see idrk_shaders
#   · SPKG (the older KTGL of Fire Emblem: Three Houses): shader packages of G2S containers, loose and inside the LINKDATA archive DATA0.bin / DATA1.bin, see kt_shaders and linkdata_jobs
#   · SDF (Capcom's RE Engine, Monster Hunter Rise): shader definitions inside the PAK archives (KPKA, entries zstd / deflate compressed), only the newest copy of each path, see kpka_jobs and sdf_shaders
#   · Trinity packs (Game Freak, Pokémon Legends: Z-A): BNSH inside the files of arc/data.trpfs (Oodle Mermaid, decoded by the game's own decoder in the Mac host), see trpfs_jobs and trinity_shaders
#   · SPK (Capcom's MT Framework, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles): the shader package inside an ARC archive (zlib entries), code area + control section per shader, see mtarc_members and mtspk_shaders
#   · BEA (NintendoWare Bezel Engine archives, Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain): BNSH in the .bfsha entries of the archives (zstd entries), see bea_members
#   · MGFX (MonoGame effects, Celeste): the effects in its XNB files and SpriteBatch's in main, each shader a control section and a code area, see mgfx_effect
#   · dvdbnd (FromSoftware, Dark Souls Remastered): GLSLC outputs in the BND3 archives (DCX zlib entries) of the .bdt files, indexed by the .bhd5 beside each, see bhd5_entries and bdt_shaders
# Code area: 0x30 header + (graphics) 0x50 SPH + instructions; header magic 0x12345678 for graphics, 0x12345679 for compute. The control section starts with 0x98761234, +0x704 = code area length,
#   +0x700 = start of the c1 constant segment within the code area; for compute +0x748 thread group xyz (u32 ×3), +0x754 shared memory bytes (checked one by one against PC reflection on D2R's 22 compute shaders).
# Stage: BNSH uses the stage slot; BAHS uses bits 10..13 of SPH word 0 (1 vertex 2 hull 3 domain 4 geometry 5 pixel), and a compute header means compute.
# Key = sha256(first 0x880 bytes of the control section (its own length when control +0x20 says it is shorter, see ctl_len) + code area)[:16], the same as the host's prog_get: in this game many shaders share a control section but differ in code
#   (SecredUber's 16600 stage shaders have only 3079 distinct control sections, with 6367 cases of same control, different code), so hashing the control alone picks the wrong library.
# Output: <package dir>/<stage>_<source group>.bin, each record = 'BTCDBTCD' + header (+0x28 control length, +0x2c code length) padded to 0x38 + code area + control section, one copy per key;
#   map rows have the same columns as D2R's shader_map.tsv (column 5 records where the key first appeared); the answer table has one row per compute shader {"local", "shared"} (shared memory rounded up to 16 bytes, as D2R did).
# Usage: shader_split.py <RomFS dir> <ExeFS main> <output package dir> <output map> <output answer table> [<output pair table>]   (decompressing main needs lz4: run with dm's venv python)   Environment J=concurrency (default S2A_JOBS / every core)
#   With an update: give RomFS and main as comma-separated lists (base game first, e.g. data/v0/RomFS,data/v327680/RomFS); the output is the union of both versions (see main())
#   Unity type trees need Unity's common string table, which is taken from the first main
# Pair table: (vertex key, pixel key) of every BNSH variation (every Unity program); dmsh_build uses it to give vertex shaders the outputs their pixel shaders read but they do not write (see dmsh_build.py vs_pad)
